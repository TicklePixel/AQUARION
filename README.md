# AQUARION

A virtual aquarium with population dynamics by TicklePixel



# Project description

I want to program a virtual aquarium in several stages.

1. Fish move according to adaptable equations of motion.
2. Different species of fish can prey on each other when they are within a certain range of each other
3. The fish will be able to evolve according to differential equations of their populations.
